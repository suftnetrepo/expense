        'Immunizations play a crucial role in protecting infants and young children from serious diseases. Vaccines help build immunity by stimulating the body’s natural defense mechanisms without causing the actual disease. Here are some key reasons why baby immunizations are important:',
        '- Disease Prevention: Vaccines protect babies from potentially severe and life-threatening diseases, such as measles, whooping cough, and polio.',
        '- Herd Immunity: When a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, it helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated or have weaker immune systems, such as newborns or children with medical conditions.',
        '- Reduced Spread of Disease: Vaccines help prevent the spread of contagious diseases within the community, contributing to public health.',
